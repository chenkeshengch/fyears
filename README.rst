An improved scikit-learn-like interface of XGBoost
==================================================


About
-----
scikit-learn is machine learning library for Python.

XGBoost is a new and useful gradient boosting library,
which provides a customized Python interface as well as 
a simplified scikit-learn-like interface.

This repo contains a slightly improved and customized
scikit-learn-like interface of XGBoost, heavily based on
the official codes, with some small modifications.
